HMAC_BASE
=========


##About

HMAC BASE was created for Solaris and Windows servers that were missing utilities to create Hash-based Message Authentication codes 
and then subsequently encode them in Base64/32 format. 
Normally in other Unix systems with the latest packages of OpenSSL and Base64 you can simply pipe the output from one into the other.
However if you are stuck due to server environment limitations, then this tool can help you out.

## Code Example

## Installation

If in doubt of JRE on the system, type ' java -version'
